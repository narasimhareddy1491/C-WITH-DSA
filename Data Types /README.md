### Introduction

In C++, data types define the nature of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc. Understanding data types and variables is crucial as it helps in efficient memory allocation and management.

### What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable in C++ has a specific data type, which determines what kind of data it can hold, its memory usage, and the operations that can be performed on it.

### Basic Data Types in C++

C++ provides several fundamental data types. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

| Data Type | Description                      | Example Value      |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `int`     | Integer values                   | 10, -5, 0         |
| `float`   | Single-precision floating point  | 3.14, -0.5        |
| `double`  | Double-precision floating point  | 3.14159           |
| `char`    | Single character                 | 'A', 'x'          |
| `bool`    | Boolean (true/false)             | true, false       |
| `void`    | No value (used in functions)     | N/A               |

### Modifiers for Data Types

Modifiers can adjust the storage size of the data type, which impacts memory usage and the range of values:

- **`short`** - Uses less memory than `int`
- **`long`** - Uses more memory than `int`
- **`unsigned`** - Only stores non-negative values
- **`signed`** - Stores both positive and negative values (default for most types)

#### Examples:

```cpp
short int a = -10;
long double pi = 3.1415926535;
unsigned int positive = 100;
